# Hydroponics-Weather-and-Water-Heat-Station
To track weather and water temperature data. When and if water temperature goes above or below, a text will be sent to the user so that they can make correction.

# Text Message System
An automated message will alert the hobbiest of any potential problems with temperature affecting optimal growth. Hydroponically grown plants struggle to gorw in water with temperatures greater than 85degF or lower than 65degF. Sending an automated message will allow for the real world water temperature issue to be resolved. Temperature could be automated further by adding automatic water cooling systems.

# Visualized Temperature Data
The hobbiest will be able to log into the server so that data can be visualized from anywhere in the world. Visualization will happen client side using the D3 library.

# Generating Random Temperature Data
While unuseful once in real world operation, the code genrates random weather data to simulate the hot July summers of the Salt Lake Valley. The temperature generation code will be placed on the microcontroller so that we can test the server like it were data from the real world ensuring that text message and email systems are working correctly in real time.

# Future additions
Sensors such as a camera or pH sensors could be added so that plants could be monitored further.
